I want to be able to write a interactive story for NaNoWriMo.
I want to be able to have choose your own story type story telling, but also with moving around a tilemap
This is inspired in part by "A Dark Room"
The gameplay I envision, as of now, is moving around a large graphical map, and entering "rooms" which are choose your own adventure type gameplay with optional pictures and sound

Better markdown for text?

Rooms have an onleave event, and a onenter event

Controls to view inventory, save, load, mute music

What if we require one out of a ton? Or forbid a whole group?
