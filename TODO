The goal is to have a good interactive story telling system. Like a choosable adventure book, but this system also allows for tilemaps movement.

To add:
-My story I want to tell
-Sound with tracks
	-fade in/out of songs with events
-AND and OR for event triggers
-javascript function callback on event, for advanced control
